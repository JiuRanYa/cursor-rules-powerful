# cursor-rules-powerful

This repository collects a set of highly practical and global rules, making Cursor IDE truly intelligent and preventing it from becoming "dumbed down". With these rules, Cursor can act as a real AI agent. All rules are designed for global effect and easy integration.

## Background & Purpose
This project aims to standardize and enhance the workflow of AI-powered development in Cursor IDE, ensuring high-quality, maintainable, and innovative code delivery. It is designed for developers, AI researchers, and teams seeking to maximize productivity and code quality with advanced agent protocols.

## Global Rules List
- **RIPER-5 Mode Protocol**: Five-mode workflow (RESEARCH, INNOVATE, PLAN, EXECUTE, REVIEW) for systematic, innovative, and critical agent thinking.
- **Multidimensional Thinking**: Encourages agents to balance system, dialectical, innovative, and critical thinking in all tasks.
- **Agent Execution Protocol**: Strict step-by-step execution, with explicit deviation reporting and user confirmation.
- **Bilingual Support**: All rules and documentation are provided in both English and Chinese for global accessibility.
- **Standardized Output Format**: Ensures all agent responses and code changes follow clear, professional, and maintainable formats.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Open for community contributions to continuously improve the rule set.
